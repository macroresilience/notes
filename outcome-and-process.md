# Outcome and Process

> What makes a decision great is not that it has a great outcome. A great decision is the result of a good process, and that process must include an attempt to accurately represent our own state of knowledge. That state of knowledge, in turn, is some variation of “I’m not sure.”

Annie Duke, Thinking in Bets

This is similar to the sentiment expressed in Hindu and Zen philosophy especially to focus on the process and disregard the outcome, even to be indifferent to it (as the Bhagavad Gita recommends).

The right approach however is not to disregard the outcome entirely. The outcome provides us with information on the quality of the process in a Bayesian sense. So a poor outcome should cause us to re-evaluate the process slightly, but not anywhere as much as we usually do.
